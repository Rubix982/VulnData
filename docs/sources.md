### **How to Use These Sources**

1. **Curate Data**: Collect code snippets with labeled vulnerabilities.
2. **Annotate**: Add security annotations (e.g., insecure/secure, vulnerability type).
3. **Augment**: Generate synthetic examples (e.g., modify secure code to introduce vulnerabilities).
4. **Preprocess**: Tokenize and structure the data for your model.
