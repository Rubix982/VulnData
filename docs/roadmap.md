# Roadmap

## **1. Define the Scope and Goal of the Project**
The first step is to define the overall objective and how you want to use the data:

- **Objective**: A comprehensive dataset that covers common security vulnerabilities in different programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, Go, etc.).
- **Goal**: To train an LLM (or a security-focused model) that can predict, classify, or even provide advice on insecure code patterns in various languages. You might also want to use it to flag vulnerabilities in code or generate security suggestions for developers.

## **2. Research and Curate Datasets**
Start by collecting and curating data from the following sources:

- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**: CVEs are one of the primary sources of information on publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.
  - Example: [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
  - Can be scraped or accessed via API (e.g., [CVE API](https://www.cve.org/cve-api))
  
- **OWASP Top Ten**: A list of the most common security vulnerabilities that web applications face.
  - Example: [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Static code analysis tools like SonarQube, Bandit (for Python), or Checkmarx often have datasets of known vulnerabilities.
  - Example: [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
  
- **GitHub Repositories with Security Issues**: Some GitHub repositories label issues as security vulnerabilities. You can scrape or gather data on known vulnerabilities reported in popular repositories.
  - Example: Use GitHub API to collect issues labeled "security" from various repositories.

- **Security Blogs and Whitepapers**: Collect information from blogs, reports, and whitepapers that document common vulnerabilities.
  - Examples: Blogs from security experts, vulnerability disclosure platforms like [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/).

- **Datasets from Security Competitions**: Leverage CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges and vulnerabilities from platforms like picoCTF or Hack The Box.
  - Example: [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)
  
- **Vulnerability Databases**: You could also gather data from security mailing lists, public vulnerability databases, or even university research papers that discuss vulnerabilities.
  - Example: [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/)

## **3. Clean and Process the Data**
Once you’ve gathered all this data, it’s essential to clean and process it. Consider the following:

- **Data Structure**: Create a structured format (JSON, CSV, or database) that includes:
  - Vulnerability type (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow)
  - Affected language (e.g., Python, C, Java)
  - Affected frameworks or libraries
  - Code examples (vulnerable code and fixed code)
  - Description and severity of the issue
  - Potential mitigations or patches

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the format. This could include:
  - Removing irrelevant data (e.g., issues not related to code vulnerabilities)
  - Standardizing code snippets (e.g., formatting to a consistent code style)

- **Metadata Creation**: Add metadata to each dataset entry, such as:
  - Severity score (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Type of vulnerability (e.g., input validation, authentication, cryptography issues)

## **4. Create a Unified Dataset**
Once you’ve collected, cleaned, and processed the data, you can combine it into a single format. A typical dataset for your project might include the following fields:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for each entry.
- **Language**: Programming language in which the vulnerability exists.
- **Vulnerability Type**: Type of security issue (e.g., buffer overflow, XSS, SQL injection).
- **Description**: A brief description of the vulnerability.
- **Severity**: A rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Code Snippet**: Vulnerable code and the corrected version.
- **CVE Reference**: Link or reference to the CVE.
- **OWASP Reference**: Link to the relevant OWASP Top Ten entry (if applicable).

## **5. Build and Integrate the Model**
After organizing and structuring the data, it’s time to build a model that can process and learn from this information. This could involve:

- **Feature Engineering**: You might extract useful features from the code (e.g., function names, variable names, or common patterns of vulnerabilities).
  
- **Training the Model**: Train an NLP-based model to predict vulnerabilities or flag insecure patterns in code. If you have a large amount of data, you can use deep learning techniques. If data is smaller, more traditional machine learning models might work.
  
- **Model Integration**: Create a CLI or web app where a user can input a code snippet and receive feedback on potential vulnerabilities based on the trained model.

### **6. Implement Security Testing and Code Analysis**
Once the model is trained, integrate it with code analysis tools like:

- **Static Code Analysis**: Implement static code analyzers (e.g., Bandit for Python, Checkmarx for Java) to provide real-time analysis of code vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing Frameworks**: Integrate the model with security testing frameworks (e.g., Snyk, OWASP ZAP) to enhance the automated testing capabilities of your project.

### **7. Iterate and Improve**
As with most machine learning projects, this process will be iterative:

- **Refine the Dataset**: As you test and deploy the model, you’ll likely encounter new types of vulnerabilities or require additional data to improve accuracy.
- **Model Tuning**: Continuously refine your model based on feedback and error analysis, incorporating additional features or datasets as needed.
  
### **8. Share and Collaborate**
Finally, share your dataset and models with the community:

- Open-source the dataset on platforms like GitHub to allow others to contribute or use the data.
- Publish a blog or a research paper to document your findings, explaining how the dataset and model can be used by other security engineers or developers.
