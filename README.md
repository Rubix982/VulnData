# VulnData - A Security Vulnerability Dataset Collector

VulnData is a project aimed at gathering an extensive dataset of security vulnerabilities across various programming languages. This project will scrape data from various sources, consolidate it, and present it in a unified format to train a language model that can help identify potential security flaws in code. The goal is to build a comprehensive resource for security professionals, researchers, and developers who want to understand the vulnerabilities in their codebase.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of VulnData is to:

- **Scrape data**: Collect security vulnerability data from various trusted sources.
- **Data consolidation**: Merge, process, and format the collected data into a structured and usable form.
- **Vulnerability mapping**: Categorize vulnerabilities by programming language, vulnerability type, and common exploitation methods.
- **Training a model**: Use the data to train a model to identify patterns and generate feedback for developers to improve the security of their code.

## Core Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automates the process of scraping vulnerability data from multiple sources, including CVE databases, blog posts, and security advisories.
- **Data Collection**: Collects security-related information and maps vulnerabilities to their corresponding programming languages and severity levels.
- **Vulnerability Classification**: Classifies vulnerabilities based on their type (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow, XSS) and the severity of the issue.
- **Dataset Formatting**: Consolidates the scraped data into a structured, machine-readable format (JSON, CSV, etc.) for easy model training.
- **Security Model Training**: After collecting sufficient data, this project will leverage the dataset to train a machine learning model focused on identifying and categorizing code vulnerabilities.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run VulnData locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulndata.git
cd vulndata
```

### Build the Project

To install dependencies and build the project, follow the instructions for your chosen language.

**For Rust**:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running the Project

Once built, run the project with the following command:

```bash
./vulndata --scrape
```

This will begin scraping data, consolidating it into the specified format, and initiate training the model (once sufficient data has been collected).

## Project Structure

- **/scrapers**: Contains code for scraping data from various security sources (e.g., CVE databases, blog posts, security advisories).
- **/data**: The collected raw data before processing.
- **/models**: Scripts for training and saving machine learning models.
- **/scripts**: Utility scripts for cleaning and processing the data.
- **/output**: Processed datasets in structured formats (JSON, CSV).
- **/docs**: Documentation on data sources, security classifications, and model training procedures.

## Future Plans

- **Additional Language Support**: Extend the dataset to include vulnerabilities in more programming languages.
- **More Advanced Models**: Train a more advanced model to identify vulnerabilities directly in code and suggest fixes.
- **Web Interface**: Build a user-friendly web interface to query the vulnerability dataset and get real-time analysis on code snippets.
